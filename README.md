## Description

In this project I wanted to update codebase for the Horiseon site to meets accessibility standards without changing the overall look of the site. I accomplished this editing the syntax of the project.:

- My motivation was to learn and hone my skills with html and css.
- I built this project to learn accessability practices in html and css.
- The problems it solves ranges from fixing semantic HTML elements to condensing css.
- I learned over all what accessable syntax looks like in html and css.
